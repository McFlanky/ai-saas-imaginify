## 🤖 Introduction

I wanted to try my hand at putting everything together into one big project on the scale of something I haven't attempted to touch yet. This is my culmination of learning and growing over the last 6 months put together. I decided to build an AI image SaaS platform that excels in image processing capabilities, integrates a secure payment infrastructure, offers advanced image search functionalities, and supports multiple AI features, including image restoration, recoloring, object removal, generative filling, and background removal.
